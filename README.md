## Description

**go-specs** is a fast, deterministic BDD-style testing framework for Go. It provides an expressive DSL for writing readable tests while staying close to the standard library and avoiding reflection and allocation overhead. Suites run in a fixed order with no hidden concurrency, so test results are stable and reproducible.

## Key features

- **BDD-style API** — `Describe`, `When`, `It`, `BeforeEach`, and `AfterEach` for structured specs
- **Deterministic execution** — Specs run in declaration order; no map iteration or nondeterministic scheduling
- **Low overhead** — Zero allocations on the assertion fast path; compiled execution plan
- **Rich assertions** — `Expect(x).ToEqual(y)`, matchers (`BeTrue`, `Equal`, `BeNil`, etc.), and snapshot testing
- **Combinatorial testing** — Path builder for deterministic exploration of parameter spaces
- **Lightweight mocking** — Spies and argument matchers without heavy code generation

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/getsyntegrity/go-specs
```

## Basic example

```go
package math_test

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/getsyntegrity/go-specs/specs"
)

func TestMath(t *testing.T) {
	specs.Describe(t, "math", func(s *specs.Spec) {
		s.It("adds numbers", func(ctx *specs.Context) {
			ctx.Expect(1 + 1).ToEqual(2)
		})
	})
}
```

## Hooks example

Use `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` for per-spec setup and teardown:

```go
func TestMathWithHooks(t *testing.T) {
	specs.Describe(t, "math", func(s *specs.Spec) {
		s.BeforeEach(func(ctx *specs.Context) {
			// runs before each It
		})

		s.It("adds numbers", func(ctx *specs.Context) {
			ctx.Expect(add(1, 2)).ToEqual(3)
		})
	})
}
```

See [examples/basic](examples/basic) and [examples/hooks](examples/hooks) for runnable examples.

## Benchmarks

go-specs is built for low latency and zero allocations on the hot path. The tables below compare single-assertion cost, runner execution (1000 specs), hooks, matchers, and suite scaling against Testify and Gomega. Values are averaged from `make bench-report` (10 runs).

### Assertions

| Framework                 | ns/op   | allocs |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| go-specs EqualTo          | ~1 ns   | 0      |
| go-specs Expect().ToEqual  | ~7.4 ns | 0      |
| Testify Equal              | ~86 ns  | 0      |
| Gomega Expect().To(Equal)  | ~241 ns | 3      |

### Runner (1000 specs, one assertion per spec)

| Framework | ns/op   |
| --------- | ------- |
| go-specs  | ~1.7 µs |
| Testify   | ~85 µs  |
| Gomega    | ~244 µs |

### Hooks (100 specs, 5 nested BeforeEach + one assertion per spec)

| Framework | ns/op   |
| --------- | ------- |
| go-specs  | ~199 ns |
| Testify   | ~8.5 µs |
| Gomega    | ~24 µs  |

### Matcher (Expect().To(Equal) style)

| Framework | ns/op   | allocs |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| go-specs  | ~7.8 ns | 0      |
| Gomega    | ~227 ns | 3      |

### Suite scaling (go-specs)

| Specs | Time    |
| ----- | ------- |
| 100   | ~201 ns |
| 1000  | ~1.7 µs |
| 10000 | ~17 µs  |
| 50000 | ~85 µs  |

### Why go-specs is fast

- **Zero allocations** — The assertion and runner hot paths allocate nothing on success (0 allocs/op above), reducing GC pressure.
- **Compiled execution plan** — Suites are compiled once into a fixed program; the runner executes steps via direct function dispatch instead of per-spec lookups or reflection.
- **No reflection** — Assertions use generics and direct comparison; the fast path avoids `reflect.DeepEqual` and runtime type switches.
- **Sequential runner loop** — The runner invokes spec and hook functions in a simple loop with direct calls; no matcher heap allocations or indirection on the hot path.

Reproducible benchmark suite: [benchmarks/](benchmarks/). From the repository root run `make bench` (quick) or `make bench-report` to generate a report in `benchmarks/results/current.txt`.

## Architecture overview

go-specs compiles a spec tree (from `Describe` / `It` / `BeforeEach` / etc.) into an execution plan once. The runner then executes that plan in order: for each spec it runs before hooks, the spec body, and after hooks (LIFO). No maps or reflection are used at run time; the plan is a flat sequence of steps with direct function pointers. Parallel specs (`ItParallel` via the Builder) are grouped into a single step and run concurrently, then execution continues sequentially. The repository is a single Go module; packages include:

- **specs** — Core DSL, runner, context, and execution plan
- **assert** — Matcher implementations (Equal, BeTrue, BeNil, etc.)
- **benchmarks** — Benchmark suite (go-specs vs Testify vs Gomega)
- **mock** — Spies and argument matchers
- **snapshots** — Snapshot testing support
- **examples** — Example tests (basic, hooks, parallel, and more)

## Running benchmarks

From the repository root:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make bench` | Run benchmarks once (output to terminal). |
| `make bench-report` | Run benchmarks 10 times and write report to `benchmarks/results/current.txt`. |
| `make bench-compare` | Compare `benchmarks/results/previous.txt` vs `current.txt` with [benchstat](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat) (install: `go install golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat@latest`). |

**Generate a report for the README or CI:**

```bash
make bench-report
```

**Compare before/after a change:**

```bash
make bench-report
cp benchmarks/results/current.txt benchmarks/results/previous.txt
# ... make your changes ...
make bench-report
make bench-compare
```

Run by category (direct `go test`):

```bash
go test ./benchmarks -bench=BenchmarkAssertion -benchmem
go test ./benchmarks -bench=BenchmarkRunner -benchmem
go test ./benchmarks -bench=BenchmarkSuite_ -benchmem
```

See [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md) for full benchmark layout and options.
