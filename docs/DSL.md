# DSL API

The go-specs DSL is the user-facing API for defining tests. This document describes each construct and execution order.

## Describe

`Describe` starts a suite or a nested block. It takes a test handle (`*testing.T` or `*testing.B`), a name, and a callback that receives a `*Spec`.

```go
specs.Describe(t, "math", func(s *specs.Spec) {
    // register hooks and specs on s
})
```

Nested `Describe` (when using the Builder API) creates nested scope; hooks from outer blocks run before and after inner specs.

## BeforeEach

`BeforeEach` registers a function that runs before every `It` in the current scope (and nested scopes). Use it for setup that must run before each spec.

```go
s.BeforeEach(func(ctx *specs.Context) {
    // reset state, create fixtures, etc.
})
```

Multiple `BeforeEach` calls in the same scope run in registration order (outer scope first, then inner).

## AfterEach

`AfterEach` registers a function that runs after every `It` in the current scope. Execution order is **LIFO**: innermost after runs first, then outer.

```go
s.AfterEach(func(ctx *specs.Context) {
    // teardown, release resources
})
```

## It

`It` registers a single spec (test case). The function receives the execution context.

```go
s.It("adds numbers", func(ctx *specs.Context) {
    ctx.Expect(1 + 1).ToEqual(2)
})
```

Each `It` is compiled into a step sequence: before hooks (outer to inner), then the spec body, then after hooks (inner to outer).

## ItParallel

`ItParallel` registers a spec that runs in parallel with adjacent `ItParallel` specs. It is available on the **Builder** API, not on the top-level `Describe` path.

```go
b := specs.NewBuilder()
b.Describe("suite", func() {
    b.ItParallel("A", func(ctx *specs.Context) { ctx.Expect(add(1, 1)).ToEqual(2) })
    b.ItParallel("B", func(ctx *specs.Context) { ctx.Expect(add(2, 2)).ToEqual(4) })
})
prog := b.Build()
specs.NewRunner(prog).Run(t)
```

Consecutive `ItParallel` specs are grouped into one parallel step; they run concurrently, then execution continues with the next sequential step.

Each `ItParallel` spec runs on its own `*specs.Context`. `ctx.T` is `nil` inside these bodies — sharing the real `*testing.T` across goroutines is not safe, so use `ctx.Expect(...)` for assertions instead of `ctx.T` directly.

A failing assertion still stops the rest of that spec body, same as in a sequential `It` — code after a failed `ctx.Expect(...)` inside `ItParallel` does not run. Every spec in the parallel group always runs to completion before the runner moves on; `Runner.FailFast` only takes effect at the next group, it cannot cancel a sibling `ItParallel` spec mid-group.

## Expect and EqualTo

Assertions use the context. Two main styles:

**`EqualTo`** — Direct equality; zero allocations on the fast path.

```go
specs.EqualTo(ctx, actual, expected)
```

**`Expect` / `ToEqual`** — Fluent style; still zero allocations when using `ExpectT(ctx, x).ToEqual(y)` for comparable types.

```go
ctx.Expect(1 + 1).ToEqual(2)
// or with matchers:
ctx.Expect(value).To(specs.BeTrue())
ctx.Expect(value).To(specs.Equal(expected))
```

`ExpectT(ctx, x).ToEqual(y)` is the preferred form for typed equality; it avoids matcher allocations.

### Equality semantics differ between the three `ToEqual`-shaped APIs — by design

`EqualTo`, `ExpectT(ctx, x).ToEqual(y)`, and `ctx.Expect(x).ToEqual(y)` do not always agree on equal-looking values, because they trade off differently between speed and generality:

| API | Constraint | Comparison |
|---|---|---|
| `EqualTo(ctx, actual, expected)` | `T comparable` (compile-time) | Go's `==`, always. No reflection. |
| `ExpectT(ctx, x).ToEqual(y)` | `T comparable` (compile-time) | Go's `==`, always. No reflection. |
| `ctx.Expect(x).ToEqual(y)` | `any` | `==` for `int`/`string`/`bool`/`int64`/`float64`/`uint` (fast path), `reflect.DeepEqual` for everything else. |

The `comparable`-constrained pair (`EqualTo`/`ExpectT`) can't even be called with a slice or map — that's a compile error, not a runtime surprise. But for a struct (or any type) that holds a pointer, interface, or other reference field, `==` compares those fields by identity while `reflect.DeepEqual` compares them by value:

```go
type withPtr struct{ N *int }
a, b := 5, 5
x, y := withPtr{&a}, withPtr{&b}

x == y                    // false — different pointers
reflect.DeepEqual(x, y)   // true  — same pointed-to value
```

So `EqualTo(ctx, x, y)` fails while `ctx.Expect(x).ToEqual(y)` passes, for the exact same `x`/`y`. This is the tradeoff: pick `EqualTo`/`ExpectT` for the zero-allocation, no-reflection fast path when your type's `==` already means what you want (primitives, or plain value structs with no pointer/interface fields); pick `ctx.Expect(...).ToEqual(...)` when you need value-based deep equality for structs, slices, or maps.

## Example

```go
package math_test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/pablogore/go-specs/specs"
)

func setup(ctx *specs.Context) {
    // per-spec setup
}

func TestMath(t *testing.T) {
    specs.Describe(t, "math", func(s *specs.Spec) {
        s.BeforeEach(setup)

        s.It("adds numbers", func(ctx *specs.Context) {
            ctx.Expect(1 + 1).ToEqual(2)
        })
    })
}
```

## Execution order of hooks

For nested describes, before hooks run **outer to inner**; after hooks run **inner to outer** (LIFO).

**Example:**

- `Describe("outer")` with `BeforeEach` A and `AfterEach` D  
- `Describe("inner")` with `BeforeEach` B and `AfterEach` C  
- One `It` (test)

Execution order:

**A → B → test → C → D**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    BeforeOuter[A BeforeEach] --> BeforeInner[B BeforeEach]
    BeforeInner --> Test[Spec Execution]
    Test --> AfterInner[C AfterEach]
    AfterInner --> AfterOuter[D AfterEach]
```

So: outer before (A), then inner before (B), then the spec body, then inner after (C), then outer after (D). This order is fixed at compile time when the builder flattens hooks into the step list.
