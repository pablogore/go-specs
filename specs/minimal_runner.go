// minimal_runner.go implements a high-performance runner: slice of specs, single execution loop
// and optional parallel execution via RunParallel.
//
// Architecture:
//   - Runner holds a slice of RunSpec structs (no interface, no reflection).
//   - Run: one context from pool, single loop; zero allocs.
//   - RunParallel: worker pool, one context per worker from pool; failures recorded by spec index, reported in order.
